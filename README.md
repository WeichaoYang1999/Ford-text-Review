# Data Science Projects

This repository contains three Jupyter notebooks related to various aspects of data science. Below, you'll find a brief description of each notebook.

## Text Normalization Function

[Text_Normalization_Function.ipynb](Text_Normalization_Function.ipynb) contains code for text preprocessing and normalization. This includes functions for tasks like tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and removing stop words.

### Key Features
- Tokenization
- Lemmatization
- Removal of stop words

## Supervised Learning

[Supervised Learning.ipynb](Supervised Learning.ipynb) focuses on different supervised learning techniques. The notebook demonstrates how to build and evaluate models such as linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, and more.

### Key Features
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Model Evaluation

## Topic Modeling

[Topic Modeling.ipynb](Topic Modeling.ipynb) explores topic modeling techniques like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). It includes code for preprocessing, model building, and visualization of topics.

### Key Features
- Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
- Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
- Visualization of Topics

## Dependencies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- PyTorch
